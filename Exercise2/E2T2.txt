Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1. CloudTrail not enabled.
2. ALB not redirecting HTTP to HTTPS.
3. Root account is being used.
4. IAM policy allows full access to resources, violating least privilege.
5. S3 buckets lack SSE and logging.
6. Security Groups allow all traffic, breaking AWS best practices.
7. EC2 instance port 5000 is publicly accessible.

Recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities
 
1. Enable CloudTrail with logs stored in S3.
2. Restrict Security Groups to allow only required ports (80, 443), and reference other security groups for internal traffic.
3. Configure ALB to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
4. Restrict IAM policies, disallow root access, enforce MFA, and apply least privilege.
5. Enable SSE and logging for S3.
6. Close non-essential EC2 ports.
