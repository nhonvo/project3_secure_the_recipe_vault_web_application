# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
1. Terraform Compliance: https://terraform-compliance.com/
2. Clair: https://github.com/quay/clair
3. Chef Inspect: https://github.com/inspec/inspec

### Example vulnerability
1. Detects whether security groups are configured to allow unrestricted inbound access (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0) to sensitive ports, which can expose applications to unauthorized access.
2. Access logs not enabled to resources that support it

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
1. Ansible

### Example vulnerability
1. SSH root access with password logon

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
1. AWS Config
2. AWS Inspector
3. AWS GuardDuty

### Example vulnerability
1. An IAM role assigned a policy that allows admin access
2. s3-bucket-server-side-encryption
3. UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce
